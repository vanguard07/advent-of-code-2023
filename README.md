# Advent of Code 2023 Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the Advent of Code 2023 repository! This repository will be used to host my solutions for the Advent of Code programming challenges for the year 2023. I'm excited to take on this challenge and use it as an opportunity to learn and explore the Go programming language.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. It consists of daily programming challenges that range in difficulty and cover a variety of topics. The challenges are a great way to improve coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and explore new programming languages.

## Learning Go

As a part of my personal development goals, I have decided to use Advent of Code 2023 as a platform to learn Go. Therefore, please be aware that the code in this repository may not be highly optimized, and there might be room for improvement. I appreciate any feedback or suggestions from the Go community to enhance my understanding of the language and improve the quality of the code.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day containing the code for the corresponding Advent of Code challenge.

## Getting Started

To run the code, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. Each day's code is contained in a separate folder and may include input files and additional resources required for execution.

```bash
# Example of running a Go file
go run day01/q1.go
```

Happy coding!
